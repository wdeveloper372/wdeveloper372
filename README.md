👋 Hi, I'm William De Leon
Software Developer | CS Student at CSU Bakersfield

I am a developer specializing in Python and Full-Stack automation. I’m currently pivoting from a background in technical diagnostics into software engineering. I’ve found that diagnosing a rough engine and debugging a broken script require the exact same logical breakdown—a realization that drives my approach to building robust, clean code.
🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

    Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

    Backend & Logic: REST APIs, JSON Parsing, Asynchronous Programming.

    Concepts: Data Structures & Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Database Management.

    Tools: Git/GitHub, Technical Documentation, Automated Scripting.

    Cloud: AWS Solutions Architect Associate (Candidate).

🚀 Impact Highlights

    Logic-Driven Development: Built a custom estimation engine that reduced business quoting time by 40% and eliminated manual calculation errors.

    System Diagnostics: Transitioned years of experience troubleshooting physical mechanical/electrical systems into a rigorous "debugging" mindset for software.
